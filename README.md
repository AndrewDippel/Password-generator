for this project we were asked to create the javascript for a random password generator. where you click a button and get prompted to select the length of the password you require between 8 and 128 characters, followed by being prompted if you would like to use cappital letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.


my motivation for this project was to understand and put into use the concepts and mechanics of arrays, for loops, if statements and random selectors which i will later be able to impliment to future projects.


in this project i learnt how the "random" function works as well as how to pull elements from an array and push them to a new array, i also learnt how to bring up an allert message, prompt message and confirm windowi was also able to get more familiar with "if" statements, the "or" function and using arrays.
